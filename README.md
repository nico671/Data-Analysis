# Baseball Data Analysis

This repository is dedicated to analyzing baseball data. This is more of an experimentation repository where I try out different models and techniques to see what insights can be gleaned from baseball statistics. Currently the only finished analysis is an Elo rating system for predicting game outcomes. More analyses may be added in the future.
